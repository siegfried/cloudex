## 1.0.1 (2017-11-27)
- Thanks @joshsmith for fixing some dialyzer errors and adding a proper type for Cloudex.UploadedImage

## 1.0.0 (2017-10-17)
- Breaking change : When uploading a single file or url you will no
  longer get a `[{:ok, %Cloudex.UploadedImage{}}]` but just a tuple like
  `{:ok, %Cloudex.UploadedImage{}}`, uploading multiple files/urls will
  return a list of tuples just like it already did.

```
Cloudex.Url.for("a_public_id", [
  %{border: "5px_solid_rgb:c22c33", radius: 5, crop: "fill", height: 246, width: 470, quality: 80},
  %{overlay: "my_overlay", crop: "scale", gravity: "south_east", width: 128 ,x: 5, y: 15}
])

"//res.cloudinary.com/my_cloud_name/image/upload/bo_5px_solid_rgb:c22c33,c_fill,h_246,q_80,r_5,w_470/c_scale,g_south_east,l_my_overlay,w_128,x_5,y_15/a_public_id"
```
